## LIBRARY
- [ ] ? Make master have a canvas class instead of just storing as a var
- [x] Add a loader scene for loading in assets
- [ ] Add a justPressed method to keyboard
- [ ] Camera should have an array for tranformations. So multiple transformations could be applied at once!
- [ ] Zoom needs to scale images~!
- [ ] mouse input? for gui
- [ ] progress for loading would be nice...
- [x] Make everything use guppy-lib module!
- [x] Sprite extends Rect/Area for collisions + LEFT + TOP + RIGHT + BOTTOM

## GAME
- [ ] win somehow needs to access game scene, or a static game class.
- [ ] Lets make player physics
- [ ] Make world <-- this is next please
- [ ] Do some collision stuff, I bet some of it should be part of the library
- [ ] make the loadLevel.js load json files from a folder.

how will collision work? need some way to get all statuses i think that is how original worked.
efficient collision method where if colliding, move until no longer colliding with that SPECIFIC block.
