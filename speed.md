Collision is done with each group of blocks, not every block. (unknown how fast)
World is stored in chunks, so collision is only checked with the chunks the player is in (unknown how fast)
Groups of blocks are drawn with a ctx pattern, so only one draw call is made (unknown how fast) (up to 20x as fast according to chatGPT)
When stuck in a block, collision checks are only done with that one block (unknown how fast)
Many things such as the world data are now stored in Maps instead of Arrays (value lookups are ~130x as fast)
