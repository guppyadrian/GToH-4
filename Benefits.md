Stuff over the original GToH:
- All assets are preloaded
- Allows for multiple scenes (settings, main menu, etc)
- Allows for custom keybinds
- Level browser
- Better performance
- You can choose between true legacy, legacy, and reimagined physics
    - true legacy: unoptimized, but preserves some niche interactions
    - legacy: legacy but optimized, sometimes has problems with overlapping blocks
    - reimagined: updated to be faster paced and have a higher skill cap
